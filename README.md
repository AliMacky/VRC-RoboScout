VRC RoboScout is still under heavy developmemt and this may change once more functionality has been implemented.

## Testing and building
Testing is strongly encouraged and jncredibly valuable during this stage of developmemt. Please feel free to do so and give feedback in the development Discord server.

You will have to generate a RobotEvents API key to run VRC RoboScout. You may do this at https://www.robotevents.com/api/v2. Add it to your run scheme in Xcode under `ROBOTEVENTS_API_KEY` in environment variables.
